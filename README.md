Sentence Auto-Completion using LSTM 📝🚀
This project implements a Sentence Auto-Completion model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model is trained on the Holmes.txt dataset from Kaggle to predict and complete sentences based on input text.

📌 Features
✔️ Uses LSTM for sequence prediction
✔️ Trained on Holmes.txt dataset (Sherlock Holmes stories)
✔️ Implements tokenization, padding, and word embedding
✔️ Generates sentence completions based on input text
✔️ Implemented in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for training is Holmes.txt, available on Kaggle. You can download it from here:
